In this age of information technology most people frequently use digital devices and social media platforms for communicating, socialising, performing financial transactions, finding information, etc. It has become easy to share data, making information available and accessible to those who want it. Although ICTs have made our daily lives convenient and have placed information within easy and immediate reach of most people, we must be aware of some of the potential challenges that arise from this progress.

In our investigation, we did research on what exactly privacy is. We looked at the types of privacies, why online privacy is important and if it is ethical or unethical, and why. During the research we also investigated how privacy violations affect you, how your information is used and examples of the violations. Lastly, we looked at the solutions to this problem. How the law protects people online, how they can protect themselves and whether they are of their privacy options.

<li> How did I go about conducting the investigation, considering the PAT requirements? </li>

<font face="Calibri" size="3">
We began this project by creating a focus question which helped us understand and lead this project in the right direction. We then asked research questions and grouped them into three groups. We then found reliable sources that will guide us through this investigation. After that, we created a questionnaire and conducted a survey to collect data and information which helped us answer the research questions. Then, we processed and analysed the data obtained in the questionnaire, so that we could create a spreadsheet about the research done. We used this to create a database and report about our findings gathered during the investigation. This will also help us to create a website to share our findings and knowledge obtained to more people.
